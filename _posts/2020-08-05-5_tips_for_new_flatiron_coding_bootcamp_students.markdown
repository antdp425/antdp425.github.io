So you finally decided it was time to [change things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uiwxo0vCWe4) … CONGRATULATIONS. Not to scare you off, but just know that Flatiron School (and most coding bootcamps) will push you to limits you’ve likely never been to, but trust me -- it will be so worth it at the end. That being said, lets focus on the now. Right now you are likely thinking about joining or just starting your time at Flatiron School. Included below are five tips that I think will help any Flatiron School student succeed.

1. Stick to a schedule

One of the most important things that I think helped me succeed during my time at Flatiron School, was sticking to a schedule. Sticking to schedule allowed me to section off parts of my day so that I would be able to not only focus on my studies, but not neglect other parts of my day to day life. A typical day for me went like this:

5am: Wake up, make coffee (surprise), and start progressing through the curriculum.
7am: Workout
9am: Back to progressing through the curriculum
11am: Lecture
12pm: Lunch

By noon, I would usually be done with a good chunk of what I wanted to accomplish for the day // what was required to “stay on pace” (more on this later). For this reason, I usually left the rest of the day pretty open/flexible so that I could essentially do whatever I wanted to do, whether it was playing videos games, getting out of the house, or just working on more of the curriculum. I feel that getting into a rhythm while you are at Flatiron is one of the most important things you can do to succeed.


2. Be Yourself

Between the time you start Flatiron and leave Flatiron, you will be expected to create five projects, one for each section (essentially one a month). My suggestion here is to try your best to work on projects that not only meet the requirements, but also mean something to you. Working on a project that is important to you, or that is in an area of interest for you, will not only make the project experience from start to finish more enjoyable, but will also make the experience more invaluable to you. Think about it this way: if you simply force an idea, you will most likely be very uninterested in the project from start to finish and you wont really care for making it “right” in terms of content or features, but if you work on something that you are interested in, you will naturally want to make things work or look a particular way and this will naturally push you into obtaining a better grip on the material just by having that extra bit of curiosity and interest in the project.

3. Be active

When you join Flatiron School, you’ll be placed into a cohort with a cohort lead. The cohort lead will host a few lectures a week, and will also hold study groups during project week. Interacting with your cohort members and attending these lectures / study groups will make your experience at Flatiron (and post-Flatiron experience)  infinitely better. While the study groups during project week may not seem helpful on the surface, there is a lot of value in seeing what your cohort members are doing, what they’re struggling with, and most of the time, even if you don’t have a question or concern, you will walk away with an extra nugget of knowledge you wouldn’t have received otherwise. 

4. Keep going

There are going to be times in the program where you feel like there is too much going on,  you’ll never get it, you aren’t good enough, etc. The best thing to do when this happens is to take a small break -- do something you enjoy doing or just go relax for a little. Whether you are simply overwhelmed or stuck in terms of how to solve a problem, walking away can be one of the most helpful things in those moments -- it gives your brain some time to slow everything down and see things that extra bit clearer. 

That being said, remember when I mentioned “pace” ? During your time at Flatiron you’re expected to “stay on pace” -- meaning, your cohort lead will let you know what lessons/labs they expect you to complete by the end of the day / week. My advice here is to try your best to, at the very least, stay ahead of “pace” by a day or two -- the last thing you’ll want is to get stuck on a difficult lab and fall behind. I’ve listed this at number four, but honestly, this piece of advice would probably be #2 right after “sticking to a schedule”.

5. Always Be Learning

While the Flatiron curriculum is great and provides plenty of additional resources for most lessons, don’t just read the lessons, pass the tests, and move on. After a particularly difficult lesson, go that extra step and do some digging on your own -- whether it be looking at documentation, watching YouTube videos, or reading blog posts -- doing that extra bit of digging and hearing or reading about the topic through another persons perspective/explanation can really make things “click” for you if you didn’t completely grasp it the first time around.
