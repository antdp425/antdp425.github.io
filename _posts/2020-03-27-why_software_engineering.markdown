Most people hate their jobs, but why? 


Maybe the better question is, ‚ÄúWhat ACTUALLY makes people happy at a job?‚Äù. Thankfully, in late June of 2019,  CNBC and SurveyMonkey polled a little over 7900 people, from ages 18-65, to get the answers for us -- so we don‚Äôt have to  üòé.


When taking a closer look at the [data](https://www.surveymonkey.com/curiosity/cnbc-workplace-happiness-index-july-2019/) you‚Äôll notice that the top three factors that contribute to happiness at work are (in order): doing meaningful work, being paid well, and having control over how you do your work -- meaning, where you do it, when you do it, the way in which you do it, etc. We all know that software engineering checks most, if not all, of those boxes -- that being said, I do have a few of my own reasons for getting (back into) software engineering.


## It Was Time for a Change

Before I decided to sign up for Flatiron -- I was working remotely ‚Äúat‚Äù a Quality Assurance website, as a Team Lead. I was a middle man between groups of testers on our site and QA teams from some of the largest companies in the world -- to ensure that testing efforts would run smoothly from start to finish. Prior to QA work, I was a Computer Science major (drop out). 

I‚Äôve always been pretty fascinated with computers and technology in general. From the moment my parents brought home our first family computer - I was hooked and couldn‚Äôt get enough of it. When I got to high school, one of my senior elective classes was a basic web development class. During my time in that class, I noticed that, compared to others in the class, I just ‚Äúgot it‚Äù pretty quickly.. not to mention i was having a lot of fun. Soon after that senior year, I enrolled into college and tried to think about what I possibly wanted to major in -- as you already know, I chose Computer Science -- it seemed like the right move considering everything I‚Äôve mentioned at this point.

That being said, for one reason or another I ended up dropping out, mostly for personal reasons. It was also around this time when I started working at the QA site, which worked out for quite a while honestly. Fast-forward to a little over 6 months ago, I really started to struggle with that feeling of ‚Äúwhat am I going to do / what do I WANT to do, for the next x years of my life?‚Äù. I had worked in the QA role for a few years and tried self-teaching myself web development via FreeCodeCamp (and a few courses I found on YouTube), because I knew it was something I really enjoyed -- but it just never panned out how I wanted it to, and I constantly fell off the wagon. As exciting as working remotely and working on something new everyday was, I had this nagging thought and feeling in my mind that I had to change something and try something new. Besides, I knew that Software Engineering could easily offer remote opportunities and just as many interesting daily challenges that the QA role did. 

After a few months of serious back and forth with myself, I finally decided to pull the trigger and eventually enrolled into Flatiron School.  I‚Äôve always known how rewarding this field is, both mentally and financially. I want to be able to create all the things I‚Äôve ever thought about creating, I want to make things that I know are valuable and meaningful, and honestly, the dream is to one day land a remote job and travel -- it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve always wanted to do.

Simply put -- as I mentioned earlier -- most people hate their jobs, **I do not want to be most people.**
